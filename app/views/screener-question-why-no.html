      <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-l">You do not need an isolation note</h1>
      <p>Isolation notes are only for people who have been told to self-isolate because they have symptoms of coronavirus or live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you’re at increased risk from coronavirus</h2>

      <p>You may be at increased risk from coronavirus, if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are pregnant</li>
        <li>have a condition that may increase yout risk from coronavirus</li>
        <li>are 70 or older</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The advice for people who may be at increased risk is the same as for most other people. You should stay at home as much as possible.</p>
      <p>If you cannot work from home and are concerned about having to go to work, talk to your employer. Employers must make sure suitable arrangements are in place so you can continue coming in to work.</p>
      <p>You only need an isolation note if you get symptoms of coronavirus or live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19">See guidance for employees and employers on coronavirus</a></p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you’re most at risk from coronavirus</h2>
     
      <p>People most at risk from coronavirus are sometimes called "shielded" or "extremely vulnerable" people.</p>
      <p>If you are most at risk, the NHS should have sent you a letter advising you to stay at home for at least 12 weeks and to take extra steps to avoid getting coronavirus. Speak to your GP or care team if you have not been contacted and think you should have been.</p>
      <p>If you need proof for your employer that you cannot work, the letter you received from the NHS counts as medical evidence. You do not need an isolation note. </p>
