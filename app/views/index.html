      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you’re at higher risk from coronavirus</h2>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">People at increased risk</h3>
      <p>Some people may have an increased risk from coronavirus, including people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are pregnant</li>
        <li>have a condition that may increase their risk from coronavirus</li>
        <li>are 70 or older</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The advice for people who may be at increased risk is the same as for most otherpeople. You should stay at home as much as possible.</p>
      <p>If you cannot work from home and are concerned about having to go to work, talk to your employer. Employers must make sure suitable arrangements are in place so you can continue coming in to work. These arrangements include, where possible, maintaining a 2 metre distance from others.</p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">People most at risk</h3>
      <p>People most at risk from coronavirus are sometimes called "shielded" or "extremely vulnerable" people.</p>
      <p>If you are in this group, the NHS should have sent you a letter advising you to stay at home for 12 weeks. Speak to your GP or care team if you have not been contacted and think you should have been.</p>
      <p>People in this group do not need an isolation note. If you need proof for your employer that you cannot work, the letter you received from the NHS counts as medical evidence.</p>
