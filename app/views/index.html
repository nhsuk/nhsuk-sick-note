      <h1>Get an isolation note</h1>
      <p>Use this service if:</p>
      <p>you have to stay at home for more than 7 days and:</p>
      <ul><li>you need a note for your employer</li>
        <li>your absence from work is due to coronavirus</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>You do not need a note if you have to stay at home for 7 days or less. Instead your employer can ask you to confirm why you've been off. This is called self-certification.</p>
      
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">

        <p>If you have to stay at home but feel well enough to work, ask your employer if you can work from home. If you can work from home, you will not need an isolation note.</p>
