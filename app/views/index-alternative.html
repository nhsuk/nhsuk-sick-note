      <h1>Get an isolation note</h1>
      <p>Apply for a note to confirm you have been told to self-isolate for 14 days by NHS 111 or a medical professional.</p>

      <h2>Who can apply</h2>

      <p>Use this service if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you need proof for your employer that you’ve been told to stay off work</li>
        <li>you receive benefits and need proof that you are not available for work</li>
        <li>you want to make a new benefits claim while you are self-isolating</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have been told to self-isolate for 7 days or less do not use this service.  This is because you do not need to any proof when you are off sick for 7 days or less.</p>
